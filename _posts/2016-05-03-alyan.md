It took the silhouette of a toddler,  
Spat up on the sand,  
Hands cold and unfurled, where once they might have curled around the finger of  
an elder,  
To make you notice us.

Funny;  
How this one ended life could render our collective strife suddenly clearer.

Now it wasn’t “crisis”, or “disaster”, or “ISIS”,  
That you plastered on the pages of your papers,  
But the broken body of a child.  

Strange;  
That this sodden shape upon the shore should turn us into more than mere  
numbers for you.

I can understand your thinking…  
A boat sinking is but an unseen link in what must seem, for you, an unthinkable  
string of events.  
Nothing more than a dream, swallowed up by the seas.

But this child was real,  
They were tangible,  
They were fragility, shattered,  
They were innocence,  
They were everything we shouldn’t be.

That child made its sacrifice, now lest it be in vain,  
We need you, to see in us, what you saw in them, the same.

For we live and breathe and love and laugh and cry and hope and die and dance  
and hate and joke and celebrate, and dream,  
Just as you do.  
So when you take what whatever well-trodden route might constitute, your daily  
commute,  
Think of us, on our journey.

Like you, we know, we must reach our destination,  
Unlike you, however, it just won’t be the next tube station.
