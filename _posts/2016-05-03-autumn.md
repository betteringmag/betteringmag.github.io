So boughs beheld in florid hues,  
At ease in noon and by their turn,  
Forsake the vigours of their youth,  
And move to tend and from sparks learn.  
To take up cloaks of crimson tone,<!--more-->  
To burn though bruised, with rust most rare,  
To lie in winter’s lee and fight;  
And wearily stoop down though tall;  
And with sagacity endure,  
The sighful wind’s chilling delight.  
Which wakes - ignites.
