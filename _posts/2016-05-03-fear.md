You feared a cage  
Bars of steel, immovable might,  
Trapping you in, cramping your style.
<!--more-->

I fear the abyss  
Bars of nothing- empty space,  
Silence that cuts, treading you down.

No one is known solely as fearful  
Few are remembered for being afraid  
What actually matters is not  
An absence of fear, rather  
Brave is being sick to the core  
Heart jumping, hands shaking  
Wishing yourself anywhere but the present...  
Brave is refusing to leave.
