Found a pearl drowned in the sand  
It should fly away again  
Found the the lost voice of the sun  
Don&#39;t know where this comes from  
Wasn&#39;t looking for broken gold Wasn&#39;t trying to compose<!--more-->    
But somehow days became so bold  
Now I&#39;m shedding silver bones  
At the mercy of the sea  
I&#39;ll go where it carries me  
At the mercy of the stars  
Made my home in green patch paths  
I wasn&#39;t looking for ruby red  
Wasn&#39;t looking for happy ends  
Lets lock ourselves in present tense  
Then laugh like times a friend  
Stillness breathes me to light sleep  
Calming waters give me peace  
Head stuck in clouds so high  
Laugh away my worry lines  
Eyes wide open in the sea  
Jump together  
Jump for me
