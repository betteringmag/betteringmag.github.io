You drew a jackfruit tree on the walls  
of the attic with the National Geographic  
open beside you. Dust settled  
around you as you worked.

The pencil colours surprised me by how bold  
they stood out from the dull plaster.<!--more-->  
-It&#39;s that they&#39;re new pencils,  
brand new, you said as though

having good things was strange to me.  
Maybe you were right; your pencilwork  
shone, even the greys and browns  
of the bark. You bought a tin of fruit

to let me try some, but the syrup was sweet  
and nothing like that you were drawing  
so you threw it out before I tasted it.  
I&#39;d lie and watch the dust dance

in flaxbeams of light and wonder  
how many other fruits you had tasted and I  
had not, and you would stand on a biscuit tin  
giving colour to the upper branches.
