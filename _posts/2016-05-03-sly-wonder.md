She smelt like summer  
bottled by Boots at the  
discounted price of £10  
<!--more-->

The air’s cologne  
rose up through the  
blossomed peppered lawn  
as they flip flopped through  
the back-gravelled- garden-path.   

They sat slightly apart  
catching each others eye slightly too often  
for their friends to believe  
that they no longer thought about each other  
at night   

he could still smell summer on his uncovered pillow.
