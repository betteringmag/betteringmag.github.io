I hear reports of stories of conquests,  
walls falling as I am taken from within like Troy.

This Horse is not hollow.  
It is real, tangible.  
Painful.  
And I couldn't have stopped it coming in if I wanted to.

Water flows.  
On beach and shore,  
Up springs to wells unquenched.  
Men charge, men fall, men die.  
I stand for you.
